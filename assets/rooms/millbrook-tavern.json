        "description": "Warm firelight flickers across rough-hewn wooden walls adorned with hunting trophies and old maps. The air is thick with pipe smoke and the smell of ale. A scarred oak bar runs along one wall, tended by a burly innkeeper who polishes glasses with practiced ease. Patrons huddle at tables, sharing tales in hushed voices. The door to the west leads back to the town square, while a back door to the east opens toward the forest.",
